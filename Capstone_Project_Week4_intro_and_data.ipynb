With data science and available frameworks, libraries, models for fast analysis of city areas, narrowing search as per requirements and desires, people can shorten and prioritize the list of neighbourhoods of interest and find place to live within desired budget.\n"

A km2 shape link https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/regionales/kleinraumdaten/geometrienOD.asp?Kat=6301 containing a number of administrative areas in Berlin is provided by the statistical office of Berlin and Brandenburg. However, instead of transforming the shape file into GeoJSON format and extract-ing boroughs and boundaries, I will use the github repository of m-hoerz https://github.com/m-hoerz/berlin-shapes which has a GeoJSON file containing names and boundaries of Berlin's 12 boroughs. Thank you m-hoerz! Once borough details are extracted, I will use Google Maps to obtain center coordinates (latitude / longitude ) of each borough. Then, to obtain the most common venues in each bough, I will use Forsquare API. Fortunately, **FourSquare** offers free APIs for developers to access their database of venues. Each venue in their dataset is usually categorized into a venue category, which is described in their [Developers Docs](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/categories). \n",
